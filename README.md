# beecrowd-problems
Repository containing my solutions to some beecrowd problems presented as homework.

Each file has in its name the code to the beecrowd problem.

All solutions presented here work properly, but not all of them are the most optmized.

And finally, since beecrowd does not require #include, I won't be adding them, but if you would like to compile and run those codes on your machine, you will have to add them. To know which libs to add, just try to compile the files as they are, and the compiler will inform you.
